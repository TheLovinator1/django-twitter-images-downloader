The Twitter API is dead now after Elon Musk bought Twitter. So this project is now broken and will not be fixed. Thanks for the fish. üêü

## twitter-image-collage-maker

`twitter-image-collage-maker` combines several images in tweets into one.
It runs a website that downloads images from a Tweet, combines them into a 2x1, 3x1 and 2x2 and returns the new combined
image. This program was made
for [TheLovinator1/discord-twitter-webhooks](https://github.com/TheLovinator1/discord-twitter-webhooks).
